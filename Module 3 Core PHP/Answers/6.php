//? An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number or a pluperfect digital invariant) 
//? is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

//* For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because it is a 3-digit number and
//* the sum of the cubes of its digits (1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153) is equal to the number itself.

$num = 153;
